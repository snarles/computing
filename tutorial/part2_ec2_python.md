# Part 2.  Configuring ipython notebook on EC2

In the previous tutorial, we created a Spark cluster.
Now we will configure IPython so that we can connect using your web browser at home.
NOTE: For the sake of the tutorial we will be using minimal security.
It is strongly recommended to follow the instructions in the links to implement proper security measures.

### Modify the security groups

In your AWS, modify the "AutoSpark-master" security group to open ports 8080-9000:

By default, port 8080 is used by the Spark status screen, port 8787 is used by RStudio and port 8888 by IPython notebook.

### Launch the Spark cluster

As in Part 1, set the AWS_SECRET_KEY and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY variables.

Then use the commands
```
cd ~/spark-1.2.0/ec2
./spark-ec2 -k KeyPair -i ~/Downloads/KeyPair.pem --region=us-west-2 start AutoSpark
```
to launch.
Next, we need to login to install some more stuff.  Use
```
./spark-ec2 -k KeyPair -i ~/Downloads/KeyPair.pem -s 3 --region=us-west-2 login AutoSpark
```

### Additional installation

You are now logged into the master node, an EC2 instance.
We need to install Python 2.7 and parallel SSH.
First, install pssh and pscp.

```
cd /root
yum update
yum upgrade
git clone http://code.google.com/p/parallel-ssh/
cd parallel-ssh
python setup.py install
```

Now we create an installation script `install_py27.sh` to send to all slaves
```
cd /root
yum install -y python27 python27-devel
wget https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py -O - | python27
easy_install pip
pip install --upgrade  ipython[all]
pip install --upgrade requests numpy
yum install -y freetype-devel libpng-devel
pip install --upgrade matplotlib
```
Copy the file to all the slave nodes.
```
pscp -h /root/spark-ec2/slaves install_py27.sh .
```
Execute the file on the root, and also on slaves
```
pssh -h /root/spark-ec2/slaves bash install_py27.sh &
bash install_py27.sh
```

Now create a file `py27.sh`.
Inside the file, write
```
echo export PYSPARK_PYTHON=python2.7 >> spark/conf/spark-env.sh
```

Now copy the file to all the slave nodes:

[Ariel: this is where things stopped working for me...]
```
pscp -h /root/spark-ec2/slaves py27.sh .
```

### Modify spark configuration to use Python 2.7

You will need to go through this step every time you resart the cluster.

```
bash py27.sh
pssh -h /root/spark-ec2/slaves bash py27.sh
```

### Launch pyspark

We are almost there!

Inside the EC2 instance, set up the IPython options:
```
export IPYTHON_OPTS="notebook --pylab inline --ip=* --port=8888"
```
You can set a password and SSH key through the IPYTHON_OPTS.
See refs for more details.

Since the spark cluster is already running, we need to restart it:
```
cd /root/spark/sbin
./stop-all.sh
./start-all.sh
```


Now, launch the notebook
```
cd /root/spark
bash bin/pyspark
```

Get the Public IP of the master node, e.g. 54.149.69.218.
You can use the command `hostname` to do this.

Back at home, point your browser to
```
http://54.149.69.218:8888
```

You will see the IPython notebook directory list.

### Compute Pi!

You are now looking at IPython notebook in your browser.
Create a new notebook and enter the following lines.  These are copied from spark-1.2.0/examples/src/main/python.

```
from random import random
from operator import add
```

This next line is where the magic happens:
```
from pyspark import SparkContext
```

This will create an object called `sc` which is the connection to your cluster.

Now we can compute pi:

    partitions = 2
    n = 100000 * partitions

    def f(_):
        x = random() * 2 - 1
        y = random() * 2 - 1
        return 1 if x ** 2 + y ** 2 < 1 else 0

    count = sc.parallelize(xrange(1, n + 1), partitions).map(f).reduce(add)
    print "Pi is roughly %f" % (4.0 * count / n)

While it is computing, you can look at the terminal conencted to the master node to view all the status messages.
Finally, close the connection:

    sc.stop()
